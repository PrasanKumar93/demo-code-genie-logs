+
+**Detailed Explanation**: 
+Develop utility functions in a Node.js TypeScript project to perform basic MongoDB operations: inserting JSON data and reading data by ID or filters. These functions should be integrated into the existing codebase, ensuring they are reusable and maintainable. Follow best practices of Node.js, TypeScript, and Vitest.
+
+**Business Context**:
+This utility will streamline database operations, making it easier for developers to interact with MongoDB within the project.
+
+**Aider instructions**:
+Create utility functions in a Node.js TypeScript project for MongoDB operations: insert JSON data and read by ID or filters. Ensure functions are reusable and maintainable. Validate JSON format, handle errors, and write unit tests using Vitest. Use MongoDB Node.js Driver and TypeScript. Sanitize inputs to prevent NoSQL injection and optimize queries for performance. Add logging for operations. Confirm folder structure and follow best practices of Node.js, TypeScript, and Vitest.
+
+---
+
+## SCOPE DEFINITION
+
+### IN SCOPE
+
+1. Creating utility functions for MongoDB insert and read operations.
+2. Writing unit tests for the new utility functions.
+
+### OUT OF SCOPE
+
+1. Implementing complex query operations beyond basic insert and read.
+2. Handling database migrations or schema changes.
+
+---
+
+## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+
+1. Given valid JSON data, when inserted, then it should be retrievable from the database.
+2. Given a valid document ID, when queried, then the correct document should be returned.
+3. Given a set of filters, when queried, then all matching documents should be returned.
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
+
+### Dependencies & Technologies
+
+1. MongoDB Node.js Driver
+2. TypeScript
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+1. Ensure JSON data is correctly formatted before insertion.
+2. Validate that the 'find by id' function returns the correct document or null if not found.
+3. Ensure 'find by filters' returns an array of documents matching the criteria.
+4. Handle MongoDB connection errors gracefully.
+
+---
+
+
+## TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
+
+1. The project uses MongoDB as its database.
+2. The project is written in Node.js with TypeScript.
+3. No existing MongoDB utility functions are present in the codebase.
+
+---
+
+## SUGGESTED FILE CHANGES
+
+
+1. **File**: `src/utils/mongoUtils.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add new utility functions for MongoDB operations.
+
+2. **File**: `tests/utils/mongoUtils.test.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add unit tests for the MongoDB utility functions.
+
+3. **File**: `src/utils`
+   **Rationale**: Add in src/utils folder, also add package in package.json
+
+---
+
+## ADDITIONAL NOTES
+
+Consider adding logging for database operations to aid in debugging and monitoring.
+

+

+
+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+Since the task context does not provide specific reference files, we will assume a typical Node.js TypeScript project structure. The project likely has a `src` directory for source code and a `tests` directory for unit tests. The MongoDB utility functions will be added to a new file in the `src/utils` directory, and corresponding tests will be added to the `tests/utils` directory. The project should already have TypeScript and MongoDB Node.js Driver as dependencies.
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+The goal is to create utility functions for basic MongoDB operations: inserting JSON data and reading data by ID or filters. These functions should be reusable, maintainable, and follow best practices for Node.js and TypeScript. We will also add logging for operations and handle errors gracefully. The implementation will include:
+
+- A utility module for MongoDB operations.
+- Functions for inserting data, finding by ID, and finding by filters.
+- Input validation and error handling.
+- Logging for database operations.
+- Unit tests using Vitest.
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Create MongoDB Utility Module**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongoUtils.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a new file for MongoDB utility functions.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Import necessary modules (`mongodb`, `winston` for logging).
+  - Set up a MongoDB client connection.
+  - Export functions for `insertDocument`, `findById`, and `findByFilters`.
+- **Rationale**: Centralize MongoDB operations in a single module for reusability.
+- **Addresses**: Basic structure for MongoDB operations.
+
+**Step 2: Implement `insertDocument` Function**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongoUtils.ts`
+- **Action**: Add a function to insert JSON data into a MongoDB collection.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Validate JSON input.
+  - Use the MongoDB client to insert data.
+  - Log the operation.
+  - Handle and log errors.
+- **Rationale**: Allow insertion of JSON data into the database.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria for inserting JSON.
+
+**Step 3: Implement `findById` Function**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongoUtils.ts`
+- **Action**: Add a function to find a document by its ID.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Validate the ID format.
+  - Use the MongoDB client to query by ID.
+  - Log the operation.
+  - Handle and log errors.
+- **Rationale**: Retrieve documents by their unique identifier.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria for finding by ID.
+
+**Step 4: Implement `findByFilters` Function**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongoUtils.ts`
+- **Action**: Add a function to find documents by filters.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Validate filter input.
+  - Use the MongoDB client to query with filters.
+  - Log the operation.
+  - Handle and log errors.
+- **Rationale**: Retrieve documents matching specific criteria.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria for finding by filters.
+
+**Step 5: Set Up Unit Tests**
+- **File**: `tests/utils/mongoUtils.test.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a new file for unit tests.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Write tests for `insertDocument`, `findById`, and `findByFilters`.
+  - Use Vitest for testing.
+  - Mock MongoDB operations to isolate tests.
+- **Rationale**: Ensure utility functions work as expected.
+- **Addresses**: Validation of functionality through tests.
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+- Validate JSON format before insertion.
+- Ensure ID is a valid MongoDB ObjectID.
+- Validate filter objects for correct structure.
+- Use try-catch blocks to handle and log errors.
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+- MongoDB client setup will integrate with existing database configuration.
+- Utility functions will be imported and used wherever database operations are needed.
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- Handle cases where the database connection fails.
+- Ensure functions handle empty or malformed input gracefully.
+- Consider performance implications of large data sets.
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Focus on core feature implementation.
+- Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns.
+- Ensure type safety and code quality.
+- Maintain backward compatibility where applicable.
+
+This plan provides a detailed roadmap for implementing MongoDB utility functions in a Node.js TypeScript project, ensuring they are robust, maintainable, and well-tested.
