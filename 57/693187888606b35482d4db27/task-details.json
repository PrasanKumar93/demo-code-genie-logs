  "llmTaskExplanation": "Develop utility functions in a Node.js TypeScript project to perform basic MongoDB operations: inserting JSON data and reading data by ID or filters. These functions should be integrated into the existing codebase, ensuring they are reusable and maintainable.",
  "validations": [
    "Ensure JSON data is correctly formatted before insertion.",
    "Validate that the 'find by id' function returns the correct document or null if not found.",
    "Ensure 'find by filters' returns an array of documents matching the criteria.",
    "Handle MongoDB connection errors gracefully."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test inserting valid JSON data and verify it is stored correctly.",
    "Test inserting invalid JSON data and expect an error.",
    "Test 'find by id' with a valid ID and verify the correct document is returned.",
    "Test 'find by id' with an invalid ID and verify null is returned.",
    "Test 'find by filters' with valid filters and verify the correct documents are returned.",
    "Test 'find by filters' with filters that match no documents and verify an empty array is returned."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given valid JSON data, when inserted, then it should be retrievable from the database.",
    "Given a valid document ID, when queried, then the correct document should be returned.",
    "Given a set of filters, when queried, then all matching documents should be returned."
