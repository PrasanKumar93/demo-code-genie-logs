  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of joining' field to the student registration page. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new date input field and ensuring that the backend can handle this new data field appropriately.",
  "validations": [
    "The 'date of joining' field should accept valid date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The field should not accept future dates.",
    "The field should be optional for now, but should validate correctly if filled.",
    "Ensure the date is stored in the correct format in the database."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the 'date of joining' field accepts a valid date format.",
    "Test that the field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the form submits successfully without the 'date of joining' field filled.",
    "Test that the form submits successfully with a valid 'date of joining' date."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given the student registration page, when a user views the form, then they should see a 'date of joining' field.",
    "When a user enters a valid date in the 'date of joining' field, the form should accept it.",
    "When a user enters a future date, the form should display an error message.",
    "When the form is submitted, the 'date of joining' should be saved correctly in the database."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use existing date handling libraries or components if available in the project."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Sanitize the 'date of joining' input to prevent injection attacks."

  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the 'date of joining' field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The 'date of joining' field is likely used for tracking student enrollment dates, which may be important for reporting and analytics.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding feature flags if this change needs to be rolled out gradually.",

  "promptForAider": "Add a 'date of joining' field to the student registration page. Ensure the field accepts valid date formats, does not accept future dates, and is optional. Update the frontend form and backend handling to accommodate this new field. Validate inputs and ensure data is stored correctly. Use existing date handling libraries if available. Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks. Ensure no significant performance impact on form load times."
