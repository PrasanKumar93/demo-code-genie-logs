  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of joining' field to the student registration page. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new date input field and ensuring that the backend can handle this new data field appropriately. The field should follow the dd/mm/yyyy format as per the Indian region.",
  "validations": [
    "The 'date of joining' field should accept valid date formats (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY).",
    "The field should not accept future dates.",
    "The field should be optional for now, but should validate correctly if filled.",
    "Ensure the date is stored in the correct format in the database."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the 'date of joining' field accepts a valid date format (DD/MM/YYYY).",
    "Test that the field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the form submits successfully with and without the 'date of joining' field filled.",
    "Test that the backend correctly stores the 'date of joining' when provided."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a student registration form, when a user views the form, then they should see a 'date of joining' field.",
    "When a user enters a valid date in the 'date of joining' field, the form should accept it.",
    "When a user enters a future date, the form should display an error message.",
    "When the form is submitted, the 'date of joining' should be correctly saved in the database."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use existing date handling libraries or components if available in the project."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Sanitize the 'date of joining' input to prevent injection attacks."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the new field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The 'date of joining' field is likely used for administrative purposes, such as tracking student enrollment dates.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a feature flag if this change needs to be rolled out gradually.",
