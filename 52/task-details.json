  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with TypeScript for the backend. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database. Use any date validation library as needed.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be a future date.",
    "Date of birth must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Date of birth is a required field."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that a valid date of birth in the format YYYY-MM-DD is accepted.",
    "Test that a future date is rejected.",
    "Test that an invalid date format is rejected.",
    "Test that the form submission fails if the date of birth is missing."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should accept it.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a future date, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter an invalid date format, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they do not enter a date of birth, then the form should display an error message."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) if not already in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure date of birth input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Consider encrypting the date of birth if stored in the database as it is PII."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure date validation does not significantly impact form submission performance."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is likely used for age verification or demographic analysis.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a tooltip or placeholder text to guide users on the expected date format.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."

      "assumption": "The frontend is using Next.js and the backend is using Node.js with TypeScript."
