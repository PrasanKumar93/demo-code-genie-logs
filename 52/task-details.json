  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be a future date.",
    "Date of birth must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Date of birth is a required field."

  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the form renders with a date of birth field.",
    "Test that entering a valid date of birth allows form submission.",
    "Test that entering a future date of birth shows an error.",
    "Test that leaving the date of birth field empty shows an error.",
    "Test that entering an invalid date format shows an error."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given the user registration page, when a user views the form, then they should see a date of birth field.",
    "When a user enters a valid date of birth and submits the form, then the registration should be successful.",
    "When a user enters a future date of birth, then an error message should be displayed.",
    "When a user leaves the date of birth field empty, then an error message should be displayed."

  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load time."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth field is likely required for age verification or demographic data collection.",

  "promptForAider": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. Ensure the field is validated for correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD), is not a future date, and is required. Update the form component and validation logic accordingly. Consider using a date input library if not already in use. Ensure the change does not impact form load time significantly. Log input errors for monitoring. If the tech stack or preferred libraries are unknown, clarify these details."
