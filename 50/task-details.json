  "priority": "",
  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form component to include a new input field for the date of birth. Ensure that the field is properly validated and integrated with the existing form submission logic.",
  "validations": [
    "The date of birth field should accept valid date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The date of birth should not be a future date.",
    "The user should be at least 18 years old.",
    "The field should be required and not allow empty submissions."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the form renders with the date of birth field.",
    "Test that submitting the form with a valid date of birth succeeds.",
    "Test that submitting the form with a future date of birth fails.",
    "Test that submitting the form with a date of birth indicating the user is under 18 fails.",
    "Test that submitting the form with an empty date of birth field fails."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they view the form, then they should see a date of birth field.",
    "Given a user enters a valid date of birth, when they submit the form, then the registration should succeed.",
    "Given a user enters a future date of birth, when they submit the form, then they should see an error message.",
    "Given a user enters a date of birth indicating they are under 18, when they submit the form, then they should see an error message.",
    "Given a user leaves the date of birth field empty, when they submit the form, then they should see an error message."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use existing form validation libraries or utilities if available in the project."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure the date of birth input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Validate the date of birth on the server-side as well to ensure data integrity."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is required to ensure users meet age requirements for registration.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a tooltip or help text to guide users on the correct date format.",

      "assumption": "The project uses a standard web technology stack (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript)."
