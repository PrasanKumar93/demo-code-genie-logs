+You are an AI coding assistant working on a Node.js + TypeScript project.
+When generating code, you must strictly follow the rules, conventions, and constraints defined in the following documents:
+	- Folder structure: docs/technical/folder-structure.md
+	- Tech stack: docs/technical/tech-stack.md
+	- Software Requirements Specification (SRS): docs/srs/srs-llms.md
+    - Use proper imports with js extensions (e.g. import { User } from '../models/User.js') for typescript files
+
+Instructions:
+	1.	Always consult and adhere to the folder structure when creating, modifying, or referencing files.
+	2.	Use the libraries, frameworks, and patterns defined in the tech stack document.
+	3.	Ensure all features, functions, and naming conventions align with the SRS requirements.
+	4.	If any requirement is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
+
+Create some sample users json with few fields, and seed them in MongoDB new users collection using simple node's mongo package.
+Also create unit tests for the generated code
