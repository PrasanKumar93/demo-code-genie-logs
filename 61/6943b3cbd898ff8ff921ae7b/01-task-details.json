  "llmTaskExplanation": "Develop a MongoDB utility in a Node.js and TypeScript environment that provides simple insert and read operations. The utility should include separate methods for 'findOne' and 'findMany' operations. The documents to be inserted can be any JSON structure, and no specific fields need to be indexed for performance optimization.",
  "validations": [
    "Ensure the MongoDB connection is established before performing operations.",
    "Validate that the data to be inserted is in the correct format and contains all required fields.",
    "Ensure 'findOne' returns a single document or null if not found.",
    "Ensure 'findMany' returns an array of documents, which can be empty if no documents match the query."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test inserting a valid document and verify it is stored correctly.",
    "Test inserting an invalid document and expect an error.",
    "Test 'findOne' with a query that matches a document and verify the correct document is returned.",
    "Test 'findOne' with a query that matches no documents and verify null is returned.",
    "Test 'findMany' with a query that matches multiple documents and verify all matching documents are returned.",
    "Test 'findMany' with a query that matches no documents and verify an empty array is returned."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a valid document, when it is inserted, then it should be retrievable from the database.",
    "Given a query, when 'findOne' is called, then it should return the first matching document or null.",
    "Given a query, when 'findMany' is called, then it should return all matching documents or an empty array."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "mongodb",
    "typescript"
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Implement error handling to manage database connection issues."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Optimize database queries to ensure efficient read operations."
  ],
  "businessContext": "This utility will simplify database operations for developers, allowing them to focus on business logic rather than database interactions.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding logging for database operations to aid in debugging and monitoring.",

    {
      "assumption": "The project uses Node.js and TypeScript as indicated by the task description."

      "assumption": "The MongoDB utility will be a standalone module or service within the project."

      "assumption": "The documents to be inserted can be any JSON structure."

  "promptForAider": "Create a MongoDB utility in Node.js and TypeScript for simple insert and read operations. Implement separate 'findOne' and 'findMany' methods. Ensure input validation and error handling are in place. Use the 'mongodb' package. Write unit tests to cover valid and invalid cases for insert, findOne, and findMany operations. The documents to be inserted can be any JSON structure, and no specific fields need to be indexed for performance optimization."
