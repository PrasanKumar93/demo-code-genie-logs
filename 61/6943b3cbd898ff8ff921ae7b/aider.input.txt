+
+**Detailed Explanation**: 
+Develop a MongoDB utility in a Node.js and TypeScript environment that provides simple insert and read operations. The utility should include separate methods for 'findOne' and 'findMany' operations. The documents to be inserted can be any JSON structure, and no specific fields need to be indexed for performance optimization.
+
+**Business Context**:
+This utility will simplify database operations for developers, allowing them to focus on business logic rather than database interactions.
+
+**Aider instructions**:
+Create a MongoDB utility in Node.js and TypeScript for simple insert and read operations. Implement separate 'findOne' and 'findMany' methods. Ensure input validation and error handling are in place. Use the 'mongodb' package. Write unit tests to cover valid and invalid cases for insert, findOne, and findMany operations. The documents to be inserted can be any JSON structure, and no specific fields need to be indexed for performance optimization.
+
+---
+
+## SCOPE DEFINITION
+
+### IN SCOPE
+
+1. Developing a MongoDB utility for insert and read operations.
+2. Implementing 'findOne' and 'findMany' methods.
+
+### OUT OF SCOPE
+
+1. Implementing complex query operations beyond simple findOne and findMany.
+2. Handling database migrations or schema changes.
+
+---
+
+## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+
+1. Given a valid document, when it is inserted, then it should be retrievable from the database.
+2. Given a query, when 'findOne' is called, then it should return the first matching document or null.
+3. Given a query, when 'findMany' is called, then it should return all matching documents or an empty array.
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
+
+### Dependencies & Technologies
+
+1. mongodb
+2. typescript
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+1. Ensure the MongoDB connection is established before performing operations.
+2. Validate that the data to be inserted is in the correct format and contains all required fields.
+3. Ensure 'findOne' returns a single document or null if not found.
+4. Ensure 'findMany' returns an array of documents, which can be empty if no documents match the query.
+
+---
+
+
+## TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
+
+1. The project uses Node.js and TypeScript as indicated by the task description.
+2. The MongoDB utility will be a standalone module or service within the project.
+3. The documents to be inserted can be any JSON structure.
+4. No specific fields need to be indexed for performance optimization.

+
+## SUGGESTED FILE CHANGES
+
+
+1. **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Create a new utility file to encapsulate MongoDB operations.
+
+---
+
+## ADDITIONAL NOTES
+
+Consider adding logging for database operations to aid in debugging and monitoring.

+
+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+Since there are no reference files provided, I'll assume that the project is a typical Node.js and TypeScript setup. The MongoDB utility will be a standalone module, which means it will likely reside in a `src/utils` directory. The utility will use the `mongodb` package to interact with a MongoDB database. The utility will need to handle connection management, data insertion, and data retrieval operations.
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+The goal is to create a MongoDB utility that provides simple insert and read operations, with separate methods for `findOne` and `findMany`. The utility will ensure that a MongoDB connection is established before performing any operations. It will also include input validation and error handling to ensure robustness.
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Connection**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a MongoDB connection function
+- **Details**: Implement a function to establish a connection to the MongoDB database using the `mongodb` package. This function should handle connection errors and ensure the connection is established before any operations are performed.
+- **Rationale**: A stable connection is necessary for any database operations.
+- **Addresses**: Ensures MongoDB connection is established before operations.
+
+**Step 2: Implement Insert Operation**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Create an `insertDocument` function
+- **Details**: Implement a function that takes a collection name and a document as parameters and inserts the document into the specified collection. Include error handling for insertion failures.
+- **Rationale**: Allows for adding new documents to the database.
+- **Addresses**: Given a valid document, it should be retrievable from the database.
+
+**Step 3: Implement FindOne Operation**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a `findOneDocument` function
+- **Details**: Implement a function that takes a collection name and a query object as parameters and returns the first matching document or null if no match is found. Include error handling for query failures.
+- **Rationale**: Provides a way to retrieve a single document based on a query.
+- **Addresses**: Given a query, `findOne` should return the first matching document or null.
+
+**Step 4: Implement FindMany Operation**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a `findManyDocuments` function
+- **Details**: Implement a function that takes a collection name and a query object as parameters and returns an array of matching documents. Include error handling for query failures.
+- **Rationale**: Provides a way to retrieve multiple documents based on a query.
+- **Addresses**: Given a query, `findMany` should return all matching documents or an empty array.
+
+**Step 5: Add Input Validation and Error Handling**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Enhance functions with input validation and error handling
+- **Details**: Ensure that all input parameters are validated before performing operations. Implement try-catch blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
+- **Rationale**: Improves robustness and reliability of the utility.
+- **Addresses**: Ensures input validation and error handling are in place.
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+- Ensure the MongoDB connection is established before any operations.
+- Validate input parameters for each function to ensure they meet expected formats.
+- Use try-catch blocks to handle and log errors during database operations.
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+- The utility will be a standalone module that can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
+- It will interact with the MongoDB database using the `mongodb` package.
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- Handle cases where the database connection fails.
+- Ensure that queries that return no results are handled gracefully.
+- Consider potential performance implications of large result sets in `findMany`.
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Focus on core feature implementation without unit tests (handled separately).
+- Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns.
+- Ensure type safety and code quality.
+- Maintain backward compatibility where applicable.
