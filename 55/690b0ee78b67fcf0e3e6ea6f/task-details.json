  "taskStatus": "TODO",
  "taskCategory": "",
  "priority": "",
  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of joining' field to the student registration page using Angular for the frontend and .NET for the backend. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new date input field using the Material Design library and ensuring that the backend can handle this new mandatory data field appropriately.",
  "validations": [
    "The 'date of joining' field should accept valid date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The 'date of joining' should not be a future date.",
    "Ensure the date is stored in the correct format in the database.",
    "The 'date of joining' field is mandatory."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the 'date of joining' field accepts a valid date.",
    "Test that the 'date of joining' field rejects future dates.",
    "Test form submission with and without the 'date of joining' field.",
    "Test that the 'date of joining' is correctly saved to the database.",
    "Test that the form submission fails if the 'date of joining' field is empty."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given the student registration page, when a user fills out the form, they should see a 'date of joining' field.",
    "When the form is submitted with a valid date, the data should be saved successfully.",
    "When the form is submitted with a future date, an error message should be displayed.",
    "The 'date of joining' should be displayed correctly in the user profile after registration.",
    "The form should not submit if the 'date of joining' field is empty."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use existing date handling libraries if available in the project.",
    "Use Material Design library for UI components."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Sanitize the 'date of joining' input to prevent injection attacks."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the 'date of joining' field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The 'date of joining' is important for tracking student enrollment and should be accurately captured.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a feature flag if this change needs to be rolled out gradually.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date fields."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "There is a database schema that can be updated to include the 'date of joining'."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The frontend is Angular, backend is .NET, and the database is SQL Server."

  "promptForAider": "Add a 'date of joining' field to the student registration page using Angular and .NET. Ensure the field is mandatory, accepts valid dates, does not allow future dates, and is correctly saved to the SQL Server database. Update both frontend and backend components to handle this new field using the Material Design library. Validate input to prevent security issues and ensure performance is not degraded."
