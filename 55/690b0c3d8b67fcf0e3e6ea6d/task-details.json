  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of joining' field to the student registration page. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new date input field and ensuring that the backend can handle this new data field appropriately.",
  "validations": [
    "The 'date of joining' field should accept valid date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The field should not accept future dates.",
    "The field should be optional for existing records but required for new registrations."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the 'date of joining' field accepts a valid date format.",
    "Test that the field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the field is required for new student registrations.",
    "Test that existing student records can be updated without providing a 'date of joining'."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a student registration form, when a user registers a new student, then the form should include a 'date of joining' field.",
    "When a user submits the form with a valid date, the registration should be successful.",
    "When a user submits the form with a future date, an error message should be displayed.",
    "Existing student records should remain unaffected if the 'date of joining' is not provided."
