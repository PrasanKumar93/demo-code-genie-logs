  "taskStatus": "TODO",
  "taskCategory": "",
  "priority": "",
  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "The date of birth field should accept valid date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The date of birth should not be a future date.",
    "The date of birth should be a required field.",
    "The user should be at least 18 years old."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date format.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the date of birth field is required and shows an error if left empty.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects dates that imply the user is under 18."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a future date as the date of birth, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user leaves the date of birth field empty, then the form should display a required field error.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a date of birth that makes them under 18, then the form should display an age restriction error."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) if not already in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Handle date of birth as PII and ensure it is stored securely."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is required for age verification and may be used for personalized user experiences.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a migration script if the date of birth needs to be added to the existing user database schema.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in a database."

      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form that can be modified."
