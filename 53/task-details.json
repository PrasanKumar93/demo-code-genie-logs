  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be a future date.",
    "Date of birth must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Date of birth is a required field."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects invalid date formats.",
    "Test that the form submission fails if the date of birth is not provided."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a future date as the date of birth, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they submit the form without a date of birth, then the form should display an error message."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) if not already in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure date of birth input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Consider encrypting the date of birth if stored in the database as it is PII."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is likely used for age verification or personalization purposes.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a tooltip or placeholder text to guide users on the expected date format.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in a database."

Ensure the field addition does not impact performance and handle the date of birth as PII."
