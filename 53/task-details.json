  "taskCategory": "",
  "priority": "",
  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with TypeScript for the backend. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database. Implement custom date validation as no existing library is in use.",
  "validations": [
    "The date of birth field should accept valid date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The date of birth should not be a future date.",
    "The date of birth should be a required field.",
    "The user should be at least 18 years old."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date format.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the date of birth field is required and shows an error if left empty.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects dates that imply the user is under 18."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a future date, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user leaves the date of birth field empty, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a date of birth that makes them under 18, then the form should display an error message."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Custom date validation logic as no existing library is in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure the date of birth input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Handle the date of birth as PII and ensure it is stored securely."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the date of birth field does not significantly impact form submission performance."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is required to ensure users meet age requirements for registration.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a feature flag if this change needs to be rolled out gradually.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in a database."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form to modify."
    },

      "assumption": "The frontend is using Next.js and the backend is using Node.js with TypeScript."
