+
+**Detailed Explanation**: 
+Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript that provides simple insert and read operations. The utility should support inserting any JSON schema and provide methods for finding documents by ID and finding a single document based on a query. Handle duplicate ID errors by throwing an error.
+
+**Business Context**:
+This utility will simplify database operations for developers, allowing them to easily insert and retrieve data from MongoDB without dealing with low-level database interactions.
+
+**Aider instructions**:
+Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript for simple insert and read operations. Implement methods to insert any JSON schema and read it using findById and findOne methods. Ensure input data is sanitized and handle connection errors gracefully. Use the 'mongodb' package and ensure efficient query performance. Consider adding logging for operations. Handle duplicate ID errors by throwing an error.
+
+---
+
+## SCOPE DEFINITION
+
+### IN SCOPE
+
+1. Developing a MongoDB utility for insert and read operations.
+2. Implementing findById and findOne methods.
+
+### OUT OF SCOPE
+
+1. Implementing complex query operations beyond simple findById and findOne.
+2. Handling MongoDB schema migrations.
+
+---
+
+## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+
+1. Given a valid JSON object, when it is inserted using the utility, then it should be stored in the MongoDB collection.
+2. Given a valid document ID, when findById is called, then the correct document should be returned.
+3. Given a valid query object, when findOne is called, then the correct document should be returned.
+4. The utility should handle MongoDB connection errors without crashing.
+5. Given a document with a duplicate ID, when it is inserted, then an error should be thrown.
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
+
+### Dependencies & Technologies
+
+1. mongodb
+2. typescript
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+1. Ensure the utility can insert any valid JSON object into the MongoDB collection.
+2. Validate that the findById method correctly retrieves a document by its ID.
+3. Ensure the findOne method can retrieve a single document based on a query object.
+4. Check that the utility handles connection errors gracefully.
+5. Throw an error if a document with the same ID already exists.
+
+---
+
+
+## TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
+
+1. The project uses Node.js and TypeScript as the primary tech stack.
+2. The MongoDB connection details are already configured elsewhere in the project.
+3. No specific JSON schemas need to be supported or validated against at this time.
+
+---
+
+## SUGGESTED FILE CHANGES
+
+
+1. **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Create a new utility file to implement the MongoDB insert and read operations.
+
+---
+
+## ADDITIONAL NOTES
+
+Consider adding logging for database operations to aid in debugging and monitoring.

+
+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+Since there are no specific reference files provided, I'll outline a general approach based on typical Node.js and TypeScript projects that use MongoDB. The utility will likely be a standalone module that can be imported and used in various parts of the application. The `mongodb` package will be used to interact with the MongoDB database.
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+The goal is to create a MongoDB utility that provides simple insert and read operations. This utility will include methods for inserting any JSON schema, finding documents by ID, and finding a single document based on a query. The utility will handle connection errors gracefully and throw an error for duplicate ID insertions.
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Create MongoDB Utility File**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a new file for the MongoDB utility.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Import necessary modules (`mongodb`, `dotenv` for environment variables).
+  - Set up a MongoDB client connection using connection details from environment variables.
+  - Export a class `MongoDBUtility` with methods for database operations.
+- **Rationale**: This file will encapsulate all MongoDB operations, making it reusable and maintainable.
+- **Addresses**: Provides a centralized utility for MongoDB operations.
+
+**Step 2: Implement Connection Handling**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement connection logic.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Create a method to connect to the MongoDB database.
+  - Handle connection errors and log them.
+- **Rationale**: Ensures the utility can connect to the database and handle errors gracefully.
+- **Addresses**: Handles MongoDB connection errors without crashing.
+
+**Step 3: Implement Insert Method**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement a method to insert documents.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Create an `insertDocument` method that takes a collection name and a JSON object.
+  - Use the `insertOne` method from the MongoDB client.
+  - Handle duplicate ID errors by checking for error codes and throwing a custom error.
+- **Rationale**: Allows insertion of any JSON schema into the database.
+- **Addresses**: Inserts valid JSON objects and handles duplicate ID errors.
+
+**Step 4: Implement FindById Method**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement a method to find documents by ID.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Create a `findById` method that takes a collection name and an ID.
+  - Use the `findOne` method with an ID query.
+- **Rationale**: Provides a way to retrieve documents by their unique ID.
+- **Addresses**: Retrieves documents by ID.
+
+**Step 5: Implement FindOne Method**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement a method to find a single document based on a query.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Create a `findOne` method that takes a collection name and a query object.
+  - Use the `findOne` method from the MongoDB client.
+- **Rationale**: Allows retrieval of a single document based on a query.
+- **Addresses**: Retrieves a single document based on a query.
+
+**Step 6: Add Logging for Operations**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement logging for database operations.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Use a logging library or simple console logs to track operations.
+  - Log successful operations and errors.
+- **Rationale**: Aids in debugging and monitoring database operations.
+- **Addresses**: Provides visibility into database operations.
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+- Ensure the utility can insert any valid JSON object into the MongoDB collection.
+- Validate that the `findById` method correctly retrieves a document by its ID.
+- Ensure the `findOne` method can retrieve a single document based on a query object.
+- Check that the utility handles connection errors gracefully.
+- Throw an error if a document with the same ID already exists.
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+- The utility will be imported and used in other parts of the application where database operations are needed.
+- Ensure the utility is compatible with existing database configurations and connection details.
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- Handle cases where the database connection fails.
+- Consider scenarios where the query does not match any documents.
+- Ensure proper error handling for all database operations.
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Focus ONLY on core feature implementation.
+- DO NOT include unit tests (handled separately).
+- Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns.
+- Ensure type safety and code quality.
+- Maintain backward compatibility where applicable.
