  "priority": "",
  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "The date of birth field should accept valid date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The date of birth should not be a future date.",
    "The date of birth should be a required field.",
    "The user should be at least 18 years old."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date format.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the date of birth field is required and shows an error if left empty.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects dates that imply the user is under 18."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a future date as the date of birth, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user leaves the date of birth field empty, then the form should display a required field error.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a date of birth that makes them under 18, then the form should display an age restriction error."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date handling library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) for date validation."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Validate date of birth on both client and server sides."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the date of birth field does not significantly increase the form load time."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is required for age verification and compliance with age-related policies.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a migration script if the date of birth needs to be stored in the database.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date validation and storage."

      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form to modify."

Update the form component and validation logic accordingly. Consider using a date handling library for validation. Ensure input sanitization and validate on both client and server sides. Check if a database schema update is needed to store the date of birth."
