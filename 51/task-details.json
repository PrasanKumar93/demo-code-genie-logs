  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new input field for the date of birth, and ensuring that this data is correctly captured and stored in the backend database. The field should be validated to ensure it contains a valid date format.",
  "validations": [
    "The date of birth field must be in a valid date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The date of birth should not be a future date.",
    "The date of birth should be a reasonable past date (e.g., not more than 120 years ago).",
    "The field should be required and not left empty."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that a valid date of birth is accepted.",
    "Test that an invalid date format is rejected.",
    "Test that a future date is rejected.",
    "Test that an empty date of birth field is rejected.",
    "Test that a date of birth more than 120 years ago is rejected."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter an invalid date format, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a future date, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they leave the date of birth field empty, then the form should display an error message."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) if not already in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Validate date input on both client and server sides."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is a common requirement for user registration forms, often used for age verification and personalization of user experience.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a date picker UI component for better user experience.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in a database."

      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form to modify."
