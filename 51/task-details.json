  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new input field for the date of birth, and ensuring that this data is correctly captured and stored in the backend database. The field should be validated to ensure it contains a valid date format and is a reasonable age for a user.",
  "validations": [
    "The date of birth field must be in a valid date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The date of birth must not be a future date.",
    "The user must be at least 13 years old."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date format.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects dates that imply the user is under 13 years old.",
    "Test that the form submission is successful with a valid date of birth."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a future date as the date of birth, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a date of birth that makes them under 13, then the form should display an error message."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) if not already in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Validate date of birth on both client and server sides."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the date of birth field does not significantly increase the page load time."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is required to ensure compliance with age-related regulations and to tailor user experiences based on age.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a feature flag to enable or disable the date of birth field for testing purposes.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in the database."

      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form that can be modified."
