  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be in the future.",
    "Date of birth must be in a recognized date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "Date of birth is a required field."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects a future date.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects an invalid date format.",
    "Test that the form submission fails if the date of birth is not provided."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should accept it.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a future date as date of birth, then the form should display an error.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter an invalid date format, then the form should display an error.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they do not enter a date of birth, then the form should display an error."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) if not already in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure date of birth input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Consider encrypting the date of birth if stored in the database as it is PII."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure date validation does not significantly impact form submission time."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is likely used for age verification or demographic analysis, so accuracy and validation are important.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a tooltip or placeholder text to guide users on the expected date format.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in a database."

      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form to modify."

Update the form component and add necessary validations. Consider using a date validation library if not already in use. Ensure the input is sanitized and consider encrypting the date of birth for storage. Update unit tests to cover new validations."
