  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be a future date.",

  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they view the form, then they should see a date of birth field.",
    "Given a user enters a valid date of birth, when they submit the form, then the registration should be successful.",
    "Given a user enters an invalid date of birth, when they submit the form, then they should see an error message.",
    "Given a user enters a future date as date of birth, when they submit the form, then they should see an error message."

Update the form rendering and submission logic to handle this new field. Consider using a date input library if not already in use. Ensure input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks. Update unit tests to cover new field scenarios."
