  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be in the future.",
    "Date of birth must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Date of birth is a required field."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the form submits successfully with a valid date of birth.",
    "Test that the form shows an error when the date of birth is in the future.",
    "Test that the form shows an error when the date of birth is not in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Test that the form shows an error when the date of birth field is left empty."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should submit successfully.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a date of birth in the future, then an error message should be displayed.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a date of birth in an incorrect format, then an error message should be displayed.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they leave the date of birth field empty, then an error message should be displayed."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) if not already in use."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure date of birth input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Consider the privacy implications of storing date of birth and ensure it is handled as PII."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is likely used for age verification or personalization purposes. It is important for compliance with age-related regulations.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a feature flag if this change needs to be rolled out gradually.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in the database."

      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form to modify."

  "promptForAider": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. Ensure the field is validated for correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD), not in the future, and is required. Update the backend to store this information. Use a date validation library if necessary. Consider privacy implications as date of birth is PII. Implement unit tests to cover valid and invalid inputs. Ensure no significant performance impact on form load times."
