  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form component to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be in the future.",
    "Date of birth must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Date of birth is a required field."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date in YYYY-MM-DD format.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects dates in the future.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects invalid date formats.",
    "Test that the form submission fails if the date of birth field is empty."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they enter a date of birth in the future, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user is on the registration page, when they submit the form without a date of birth, then the form should display an error message."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "React (if frontend is React-based)",
    "Form validation library (e.g., Formik, React Hook Form)"
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure date of birth input is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Validate date of birth on both client and server sides."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load time."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is a critical piece of user information that may be used for age verification and personalized user experiences.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a feature flag if this change needs to be rolled out gradually.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The project uses a modern JavaScript framework like React for the frontend."
    },

      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in the database."

  "promptForAider": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. Ensure the field is validated for correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD), is not in the future, and is required. Update the form component and validation logic accordingly. Consider using a form validation library if not already in use. Ensure input is sanitized and validated on both client and server sides."
