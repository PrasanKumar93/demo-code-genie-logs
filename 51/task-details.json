  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the user registration form to include a new input field for the date of birth, ensuring it is properly validated and stored in the database.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be a future date.",

  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a future date as date of birth, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user leaves the date of birth field empty, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters an invalid date format, then the form should display an error message."
