  "taskCategory": "",
  "priority": "",
  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new input field for the date of birth, and ensuring that this data is correctly captured and stored in the backend database. The field should be validated to ensure it contains a valid date format.",
  "validations": [
    "The date of birth field must accept a valid date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).",
    "The date of birth must not be a future date.",
    "The date of birth should be a required field.",
    "The user must be at least 18 years old."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date format.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the date of birth field is required and shows an error if left empty.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects dates that make the user younger than 18 years old."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input without errors.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a future date as the date of birth, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user leaves the date of birth field empty, then the form should display a required field error.",
    "Given a user registration form, when the user enters a date of birth that makes them younger than 18, then the form should display an age restriction error."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Date validation library (e.g., moment.js or date-fns) for handling date formats and calculations."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Validate date of birth on both client and server sides."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure that adding the date of birth field does not significantly increase the page load time."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The date of birth is required for age verification and compliance with age-related regulations.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a feature flag to enable or disable the date of birth field for testing purposes.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework like React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of handling date inputs and storing them in a database."

      "assumption": "There is an existing user registration form to modify."
