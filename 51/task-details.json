  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of birth' field to the user registration page. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new input field for the date of birth, and ensuring that this data is correctly captured and stored in the backend database.",
  "validations": [
    "Date of birth must be a valid date.",
    "Date of birth cannot be a future date.",
    "Date of birth should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Date of birth is a required field."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the date of birth field accepts a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.",
    "Test that the date of birth field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the date of birth field is required and shows an error if left empty.",
    "Test that the form submission fails if the date of birth is in an incorrect format."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a valid date of birth, then the form should accept the input.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter a future date as the date of birth, then the form should display an error message.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they leave the date of birth field empty, then the form should display a required field error.",
    "Given a user on the registration page, when they enter an invalid date format, then the form should display a format error."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "React (if frontend is React-based)",
    "Form validation library (e.g., Formik, Yup)"

  "security": [
    "Ensure input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.",
    "Validate date of birth on the server-side as well."

  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the date of birth field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "Capturing the date of birth is likely for age verification or personalization purposes.",

      "assumption": "The backend is capable of storing date fields."

Update the frontend form and backend validation accordingly. Use existing form validation libraries if available. Ensure input sanitization and server-side validation. Consider using a date picker for better UX."
