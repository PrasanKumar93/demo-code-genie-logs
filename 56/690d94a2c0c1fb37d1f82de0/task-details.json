  "priority": "",
  "llmTaskExplanation": "Add a 'date of joining' field to the student registration page using a material design library. This involves updating the frontend form to include a new date input field with the format dd/MM/yyyy and ensuring that the backend can handle this new data field appropriately.",
  "validations": [
    "The 'date of joining' field should accept valid date formats (dd/MM/yyyy).",
    "The field should not accept future dates.",
    "The field should be optional for now, but should validate if provided.",
    "Ensure the date is not before a reasonable past limit (e.g., 1900-01-01)."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test that the 'date of joining' field accepts a valid date format (dd/MM/yyyy).",
    "Test that the field rejects future dates.",
    "Test that the field accepts an empty value (optional field).",
    "Test that the field rejects dates before 1900-01-01."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given the student registration page, when a user views the form, then they should see a 'date of joining' field.",
    "When a user enters a valid date in dd/MM/yyyy format, the form should accept it.",
    "When a user enters a future date, the form should display an error message.",
    "When a user submits the form without a date, it should still submit successfully."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Use existing date handling libraries or components if available in the project.",
    "Use a material design library for the date input field."
  ],
  "security": [
    "Sanitize the date input to prevent injection attacks."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Ensure the addition of the date field does not significantly impact form load times."
  ],
  "businessContext": "The 'date of joining' field is likely used for administrative purposes to track when a student officially joins the institution.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding a tooltip or help text to guide users on the expected date format.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The tech stack includes a frontend framework capable of handling form inputs, such as React or Angular."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The backend is capable of storing date fields, likely in a database."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "There is an existing form validation mechanism that can be extended."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "Frontend is Next.js, backend is Node.js."

Ensure the field accepts valid date formats (dd/MM/yyyy), does not accept future dates, and is optional. Update the frontend form and backend model accordingly. Validate the input and write unit tests to cover valid and invalid scenarios. Use existing date handling libraries if available."
