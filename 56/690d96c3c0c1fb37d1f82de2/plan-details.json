  "detailedPlan": "### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS\n\n**Frontend:**\n- The student registration form is likely implemented in a React component, possibly using Material-UI for styling and form components.\n- The file `src/components/StudentRegistrationForm.jsx` is where the form is defined. This file will need to be updated to include a new date input field for the 'date of joining'.\n\n**Backend:**\n- The backend is assumed to be a Node.js/Express application.\n- The file `src/server/routes/student.js` handles student-related routes and will need to be updated to process the new 'date of joining' field.\n- The backend will need to validate the date format and ensure it is not a future date.\n\n**Database:**\n- The database is MongoDB, and the users collection will need to be updated to include the 'date of joining' field.\n- A migration script may be necessary to update existing records if required.\n\n### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\n\nThe implementation will involve updating both the frontend and backend to handle the new 'date of joining' field. The frontend will use Material-UI components to add a date picker, and the backend will validate and store the date. The database schema will be updated to include this new field.\n\n### 3. DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n**Step 1: Update Frontend Form**\n- **File**: `src/components/StudentRegistrationForm.jsx`\n- **Action**: Add a date input field for 'date of joining'.\n- **Details**: \n  - Use Material-UI's `TextField` component with `type=\"date\"` to add the date picker.\n  - Ensure the field is marked as required.\n  - Add validation to prevent future dates.\n- **Rationale**: This allows users to input their date of joining during registration.\n- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Step 2: Update Backend Route**\n- **File**: `src/server/routes/student.js`\n- **Action**: Modify the route handling student registration to process the 'date of joining'.\n- **Details**: \n  - Extract the 'date of joining' from the request body.\n  - Validate the date format and ensure it is not a future date.\n  - Save the date to the database.\n- **Rationale**: Ensures the backend can handle and validate the new field.\n- **Addresses**: Acceptance criteria 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Step 3: Update Database Schema**\n- **File**: `src/models/User.js` (or equivalent)\n- **Action**: Add 'dateOfJoining' field to the user schema.\n- **Details**: \n  - Define the field as a Date type.\n  - Ensure it is optional for existing records but required for new ones.\n- **Rationale**: Allows the database to store the new field.\n- **Addresses**: Ensures data persistence for the new field.\n\n**Step 4: Create Migration Script (if necessary)**\n- **File**: `scripts/migrateDateOfJoining.js` (or equivalent)\n- **Action**: Create a script to update existing records if needed.\n- **Details**: \n  - Set a default value or handle null values for existing records.\n- **Rationale**: Ensures existing records are compatible with the new schema.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY\n\n- Frontend will use HTML5 validation and custom logic to prevent future dates.\n- Backend will validate the date format and check against future dates before saving to the database.\n\n### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS\n\n- The frontend form will integrate with existing form submission logic.\n- The backend will integrate with existing student registration routes and database operations.\n\n### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- Ensure the date picker is compatible across different browsers.\n- Handle cases where users attempt to submit future dates.\n- Consider time zone differences when validating dates.\n\n### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS\n\n- Focus on adding the 'date of joining' field only.\n- Do not include unit tests in this implementation plan.\n- Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns.\n- Ensure backward compatibility with existing records.\n\nThis plan provides a comprehensive approach to implementing the 'date of joining' field in the student registration process, addressing all acceptance criteria and validation rules.",
