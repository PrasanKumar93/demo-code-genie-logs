+
+**Detailed Explanation**: 
+Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript that provides simple insert and read operations. The utility should be able to insert any valid JSON object into a MongoDB collection and support read operations such as findById, findByOne with a filter, and findMany. No specific MongoDB collections are required.
+
+**Business Context**:
+This utility will simplify database operations for developers, allowing them to easily insert and retrieve data from MongoDB.
+
+**Aider instructions**:
+Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript for simple insert and read operations. Ensure it can insert any valid JSON, findById, findByOne with a filter, and findMany. Validate JSON insertion, correct document retrieval by ID, and correct filtering. Use Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB Node.js Driver. Sanitize inputs and handle errors. Optimize for performance. Write unit tests for all operations. Consider logging for debugging. No specific MongoDB collections are required.
+
+---
+
+## SCOPE DEFINITION
+
+### IN SCOPE
+
+1. Developing the MongoDB utility with insert and read operations.
+2. Writing unit tests for the utility.
+
+### OUT OF SCOPE
+
+1. Implementing complex query operations beyond simple insert and read.
+2. Handling authentication or authorization for MongoDB access.
+
+---
+
+## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
+
+1. Given a valid JSON object, when it is inserted, then it should be retrievable from the database.
+2. Given a valid document ID, when findById is called, then the correct document should be returned.
+3. Given a filter, when findByOne is called, then the first matching document should be returned.
+4. Given a filter, when findMany is called, then all matching documents should be returned.
+
+---
+
+## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
+
+### Dependencies & Technologies
+
+1. Node.js
+2. TypeScript
+3. MongoDB Node.js Driver
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+1. Ensure JSON objects are correctly inserted into the MongoDB collection.
+2. Validate that findById returns the correct document based on the provided ID.
+3. Ensure findByOne returns a single document matching the filter criteria.
+4. Validate that findMany returns all documents matching the filter criteria.
+
+---
+
+
+## TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
+
+1. The MongoDB utility will be a standalone module within the project.
+2. The project already uses Node.js and TypeScript.
+
+---
+
+## SUGGESTED FILE CHANGES
+
+
+1. **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Create a new utility file for MongoDB operations.
+
+2. **File**: `tests/mongodbUtility.test.ts`
+   **Rationale**: Add unit tests for the MongoDB utility functions.

+## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FROM PLANNING NODE
+
+The following comprehensive plan was created by the planning node. Follow this plan to implement the feature:
+
+### 1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
+
+Since there are no specific reference files provided, I'll outline a general approach based on typical Node.js and TypeScript projects that use MongoDB. The utility will be a standalone module, which means it will not directly integrate with other parts of the codebase unless explicitly imported. The MongoDB Node.js Driver will be used for database operations.
+
+### 2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+
+The goal is to create a MongoDB utility that can perform simple insert and read operations. The utility will be implemented in TypeScript and will include functions for inserting JSON objects, finding documents by ID, finding a single document by a filter, and finding multiple documents by a filter. The utility will be designed to be reusable and easy to integrate into any Node.js project.
+
+### 3. COMPREHENSIVE STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
+
+**Step 1: Create MongoDB Utility File**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a new file for the MongoDB utility.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Import necessary modules from the MongoDB Node.js Driver.
+  - Define a class `MongoDBUtility` with methods for `insert`, `findById`, `findByOne`, and `findMany`.
+  - Implement a constructor to initialize the MongoDB client and connect to the database.
+- **Rationale**: This file will encapsulate all MongoDB operations, making it easy to manage and test.
+- **Addresses**: All acceptance criteria related to database operations.
+
+**Step 2: Implement Insert Method**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement the `insert` method.
+- **Details**: 
+  - The method should accept a JSON object and insert it into a specified collection.
+  - Handle any errors that occur during the insertion.
+- **Rationale**: Allows insertion of any valid JSON object into the database.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion for inserting JSON objects.
+
+**Step 3: Implement FindById Method**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement the `findById` method.
+- **Details**: 
+  - The method should accept a document ID and return the corresponding document.
+  - Use MongoDB's `ObjectId` to ensure the ID is correctly formatted.
+- **Rationale**: Enables retrieval of documents by their unique ID.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion for finding documents by ID.
+
+**Step 4: Implement FindByOne Method**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement the `findByOne` method.
+- **Details**: 
+  - The method should accept a filter object and return the first matching document.
+  - Ensure the filter is correctly applied to the query.
+- **Rationale**: Allows retrieval of a single document based on filter criteria.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion for finding a single document by filter.
+
+**Step 5: Implement FindMany Method**
+- **File**: `src/utils/mongodbUtility.ts`
+- **Action**: Implement the `findMany` method.
+- **Details**: 
+  - The method should accept a filter object and return all matching documents.
+  - Ensure the filter is correctly applied to the query.
+- **Rationale**: Allows retrieval of multiple documents based on filter criteria.
+- **Addresses**: Acceptance criterion for finding multiple documents by filter.
+
+**Step 6: Create Unit Test File**
+- **File**: `tests/mongodbUtility.test.ts`
+- **Action**: Create a new file for unit tests.
+- **Details**: 
+  - Write tests for each method in the `MongoDBUtility` class.
+  - Use a testing framework like Jest to run the tests.
+  - Mock MongoDB operations to test functionality without a real database.
+- **Rationale**: Ensure all methods work as expected and handle edge cases.
+- **Addresses**: Validation of all acceptance criteria through testing.
+
+### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
+
+- Use TypeScript's type system to ensure correct data types are used.
+- Implement error handling in each method to manage potential issues.
+- Write comprehensive unit tests to validate each method's functionality.
+
+### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
+
+- The utility can be imported and used in any part of the Node.js project that requires database operations.
+- Ensure the MongoDB client is properly initialized and closed to manage connections efficiently.
+
+### 6. EDGE CASES & CONSIDERATIONS
+
+- Handle cases where the database connection fails.
+- Ensure that invalid JSON objects or filters do not cause the application to crash.
+- Consider performance implications of large data sets when using `findMany`.
+
+### 7. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
+
+- Focus on core feature implementation without additional features.
+- Follow existing codebase conventions and patterns.
+- Ensure type safety and code quality.
+- Maintain backward compatibility where applicable.
+
+---
