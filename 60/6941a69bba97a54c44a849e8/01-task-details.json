  "llmTaskExplanation": "Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript that provides simple insert and read operations. The utility should be able to insert any JSON object into a MongoDB collection and support read operations such as findById, findByOne with a filter, and findMany.",
  "validations": [
    "Ensure JSON objects are correctly inserted into the MongoDB collection.",
    "Validate that findById returns the correct document based on the provided ID.",
    "Ensure findByOne returns a single document matching the filter criteria.",
    "Validate that findMany returns all documents matching the filter criteria."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test inserting a valid JSON object and verify it is stored correctly.",
    "Test findById with a valid ID and verify the correct document is returned.",
    "Test findById with an invalid ID and verify no document is returned.",
    "Test findByOne with a valid filter and verify the correct document is returned.",
    "Test findByOne with a filter that matches no documents and verify no document is returned.",
    "Test findMany with a filter that matches multiple documents and verify all are returned.",
    "Test findMany with a filter that matches no documents and verify an empty array is returned."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a valid JSON object, when it is inserted, then it should be retrievable from the database.",
    "Given a valid document ID, when findById is called, then the correct document should be returned.",
    "Given a filter, when findByOne is called, then the first matching document should be returned.",
    "Given a filter, when findMany is called, then all matching documents should be returned."
  ],
  "technicalDependencies": [
    "Node.js",
    "TypeScript",
    "MongoDB Node.js Driver"
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Implement error handling for database operations."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Optimize database queries for performance.",
    "Ensure the utility handles large datasets efficiently."
  ],
  "businessContext": "This utility will simplify database operations for developers, allowing them to easily insert and retrieve data from MongoDB.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding logging for database operations to aid in debugging.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The MongoDB utility will be a standalone module within the project."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The project already uses Node.js and TypeScript."
    }
  ],
  "llmOpenQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the expected structure of the JSON objects to be inserted?",
      "answer":"any valid json"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any specific MongoDB collections this utility should interact with?",
      "answer":"No as of now"
    }

  "inScope": [
    "Developing the MongoDB utility with insert and read operations.",
    "Writing unit tests for the utility."
  ],
  "outOfScope": [
    "Implementing complex query operations beyond simple insert and read.",
    "Handling authentication or authorization for MongoDB access."

  "promptForAider": "Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript for simple insert and read operations. Ensure it can insert any JSON, findById, findByOne with a filter, and findMany. Validate JSON insertion, correct document retrieval by ID, and correct filtering. Use Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB Node.js Driver. Sanitize inputs and handle errors. Optimize for performance. Write unit tests for all operations. Consider logging for debugging. Clarify JSON structure and target collections."
