  "llmTaskExplanation": "Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript that provides simple insert and read operations. This utility should allow users to insert a document into a MongoDB collection and read a document from the collection.",
  "validations": [
    "Ensure the MongoDB connection is established before performing operations.",
    "Validate that the document to be inserted is not null or undefined.",
    "Ensure the read operation returns the correct document based on a given query.",
    "Handle errors gracefully, such as connection failures or invalid queries."
  ],
  "unitTests": [
    "Test inserting a valid document into the database and verify it is stored correctly.",
    "Test reading a document that exists in the database and verify the correct document is returned.",
    "Test reading a document that does not exist and verify the operation returns null or an appropriate message.",
    "Test inserting a null or undefined document and verify the operation fails gracefully.",
    "Test handling of MongoDB connection failures."
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Given a valid document, when the user inserts it, then it should be stored in the MongoDB collection.",
    "Given a query for an existing document, when the user reads it, then the correct document should be returned.",
    "Given a query for a non-existing document, when the user reads it, then the operation should return null or an appropriate message."

  "technicalDependencies": [
    "mongodb",
    "typescript"
  ],
  "security": [
    "Ensure input data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.",
    "Use environment variables for MongoDB connection strings to avoid hardcoding sensitive information."
  ],
  "performance": [
    "Optimize MongoDB queries for performance.",
    "Ensure the utility handles large datasets efficiently."
  ],
  "businessContext": "This utility will simplify database operations for developers, allowing them to focus on business logic rather than database management.",
  "otherNotes": "Consider adding logging for database operations to help with debugging and monitoring.",
  "llmAssumptions": [
    {
      "assumption": "The project uses Node.js and TypeScript as the primary tech stack."
    },
    {
      "assumption": "The MongoDB connection details will be provided via environment variables."

  "promptForAider": "Develop a MongoDB utility in Node.js using TypeScript for simple insert and read operations. Ensure the utility can insert a document into a MongoDB collection and read a document based on a query. Validate inputs, handle errors gracefully, and use environment variables for connection strings. Implement unit tests for insert and read operations, including edge cases. Optimize for performance and ensure security by sanitizing inputs."
